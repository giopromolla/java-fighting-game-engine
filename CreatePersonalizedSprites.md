# Introduction #

The idea behind the Java Fighting Game engine is to create your own personalized fighting game characters, e.g. you and your friends, and assemble them together into a playable game. Creating your own fighting game sprites may sound a lot of work but the results are often worth it since the creation process is quite straight forward.

# Before you start #

Before you can start creating your own sprites be sure to have the following things ready.

  * Digital Video Camera
  * Camera Stand
  * Video and Image Processing Tools

# Find proper location #

You need to find a proper location to take videos for your own fighting characters. I guess in theory there aren't any limitations in where you take your videos, but best practice is to take the videos in front of a planar wall. In our case we do take our videos in the basement where we've got enough place for our fighter improvisations.

# Camera position and floor marks #

# Fighting character states #

After setting up your camera environment you can start creating your own character sprites. Often fighters stick to a predefined fighting style, e.g. Street Fighter 2 or Mortal Kombat etc.

You can use following character states for your inspiration:

  * Stand
  * Block
  * High Punch
  * Low Punch
  * Uppercut
  * High Kick
  * Low Kick
  * High Hit
  * Low Hit

  * Jump
  * Jump Punch
  * Jump Kick
  * Jump Forward

  * Duck
  * Duck Block
  * Duck Punch
  * Duck Kick
  * Duck Hit
  * Sweeper

  * Fall Down
  * Stand Up

  * Walk
  * Victory
  * Roundhouse
  * Fireball
